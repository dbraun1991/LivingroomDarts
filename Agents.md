### Source files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `src/index.html` | DOM structure only |
| `src/css/base.css` | Variables, reset, shared utilities |
| `src/css/setup.css` | Setup screen styles |
| `src/css/game.css` | Phone/score view styles |
| `src/css/tv.css` | TV display styles |
| `src/js/main.js` | Entry point — routing, boot, wires onStateChange; calls both renderers on every state change |
| `src/js/state.js` | Shared state object, pure helpers |
| `src/js/storage.js` | localStorage abstraction |
| `src/js/colors.js` | PALETTE constant, colour picker popup |
| `src/js/setup.js` | Setup screen logic |
| `src/js/game.js` | Dart entry pipeline, undo, review mode |

| `src/js/render-tv.js` | TV view DOM renderers + Chart.js |

### Build output

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `dist/index.html` | Single self-contained file — all JS and CSS inlined by Vite. Works on `file://` and GitHub Pages. |

### Tooling

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Vite | Dev server + build |
| vite-plugin-singlefile | Inlines all assets into one HTML file at build time |
| Vitest | Unit tests — `npm test` — config in `vite.config.js` under `test:` block |

**Test files:** `test/bust.test.js` — 21 tests covering `computeWouldBust`, `computeIsBust`, and `onStateChange` key-deletion behaviour.

Two views from the same file, determined by `?view=display` URL parameter.

### Module dependency graph

```
state.js          ← no deps
storage.js        ← no deps
colors.js         ← no deps
render-score.js   ← state, colors
render-tv.js      ← state, colors
game.js           ← state, storage, render-score
setup.js          ← state, storage, colors, game, render-tv
main.js           ← state, storage, setup, game, render-tv
```

No circular dependencies. `render-score` and `render-tv` are purely passive.

---

## 2. State Model

```
state {
  settings: {
    startScore:  number    // 301 | 501 | 701
    finishRule:  string    // 'single' | 'double'
  }

  players: {
    [key: string]: {       // 'p0'–'p9', stable per game
      name:         string
      color:        string  // hex colour
      order:        number  // 0-based throw order
      currentScore: number
      totalDarts:   number
    }
  }

  rounds: {
    [key: string]: {       // 'r0', 'r1', ...
      [playerKey: string]: {
        darts: [{ display: string, value: number }, ...]
        bust:  boolean
      }
    }
  }

  currentPlayer: string
  currentRound:  number
  gameOver:      boolean   // true only when all-but-one players have finished
  placements: {            // finish positions — set as players reach zero
    [playerKey: string]: number   // 1 = 1st place, 2 = 2nd, etc.
  }

  liveDarts: {             // written on every dart entry, null between turns
    player: string
    darts:  [{ display, value }, ...]
  } | null
}
```

**rounds format:** `{ darts: [...], bust }` per player per round — individual dart objects,
not totals. `_renderBurndown` handles legacy number format via typeof guard.

**liveDarts:** fire-and-forget field written to storage on every `enterDart()`. TV listener
reacts immediately to update chips and score without waiting for visit commit.
Cleared to `null` on `_advancePlayer()`.

**placements:** populated as players reach zero. First place is derived as
`Object.keys(placements).find(k => placements[k] === 1)`. The last remaining unfinished player
is auto-assigned last place atomically when all others have finished.
`gameOver: true` is set at that point — not on first win.

**winner field removed:** previously `state.winner` held the first-place key. Now derived
from `placements`. Any code reading `state.winner` will find `undefined`.

---

## 3. Storage (`storage.js`)

localStorage-only. Firebase has been removed.

### `writeAll(newState)`
Replaces entire state. Used for: game start, undo, End Game.
End Game writes structured reset via `createResetState()` — never bare `{}`.

### `patch(updates)`
Flat-path map. Null values delete keys.
Path format: `'darts/players/p0/currentScore'` (leading `darts/` prefix stripped internally).
Used for: scoring, player advance, `liveDarts` writes.

### `listen(callback)`
Synchronous — no async init required. Registers cross-tab (`storage` event) and
same-tab (`darts-changed` CustomEvent) listeners. Fires immediately with current state.

---

## 4. State helpers (`state.js`)

### `state` (exported object)
Single mutable object. All modules import the same reference. `onStateChange` calls
`Object.assign(state, data)` to update in-place — no module ever holds a stale copy.

### `onStateChange(data)`
Called by `main.js` on every storage event. Merges incoming data into `state`.
**Key deletion guard:** `patch({liveDarts: null})` removes the key from stored JSON entirely.
`Object.assign` silently skips absent keys, so `state.liveDarts` is explicitly set to `null`
when `'liveDarts'` is not present in `data` — preventing stale values from persisting.

### `createResetState(startScore, finishRule)`
Factory for the structured reset object used by both start-game and end-game.
Single source of truth — never inline the reset shape elsewhere.

### `playersSorted()`
`Object.entries(state.players).sort((a,b) => a[1].order - b[1].order)`
Always use — never rely on key insertion order.

### `computeWouldBust(liveTotal, currentScore, finishRule)` → boolean
Pure function. Returns `false` immediately when `liveTotal === 0`.
Otherwise: `liveTotal > currentScore` OR (double out AND `currentScore - liveTotal === 1`).

### `computeIsBust(isThrow, liveTotal, currentScore, finishRule, liveDarts, playerKey)` → boolean
Pure function. Returns `false` if: not throwing player, `liveDarts` is null, player mismatch,
or `liveDarts.darts` is empty. Delegates to `computeWouldBust` for the numeric check.
Used by `render-tv.js` for the bust indicator; also covered by `test/bust.test.js`.

### `calcAvg(p)`
`(startScore - currentScore) / totalDarts * 3`. Returns `'—'` if no darts.

### `lastDarts(playerKey, count = 3)`
Flattens individual dart objects across all rounds for a player.
Returns last `count` `.display` strings, left-padded with `'—'`.

---

## 5. Colour System (`colors.js`)

**PALETTE:** 35 hex values, 6×6 grid (35 swatches + 1 `?` tile).
- Columns: Red · Orange · Green · Cyan · Blue · Purple
- Rows: Pastel → Light → Vivid → Dark → Very Dark
- Row 6: greys + bright yellow. Near-black removed (invisible on dark background).

### `pickUnusedColor(players)`
Takes the players array as argument — no implicit coupling to setup state.
Picks randomly from colours not yet assigned. Falls back to full palette if all taken.

### `openColorPicker(swatchBtn, playerIndex, players, onPick)`
Positions popup below `swatchBtn`. Calls `onPick(playerIndex, hex)` on selection.
Decoupled from `setup.js` via callback — `colors.js` has no knowledge of `setupPlayers`.

**Colour picker popup:** singleton `<div class="color-picker-popup">` appended to body.
35 `.cp-swatch` buttons + `.cp-random-tile` (dark grey `#424242`, white `?`).

---

## 6. Setup Flow (`setup.js`)

Local vars (never persisted): `setupPlayers[]`, `selectedStart`, `selectedRule`.

**`renderSetup()`** — public export, called once from `main.js` on boot.
Calls `_renderPlayerList()`, `_syncScoreButtons()`, `_syncRuleButtons()`.

**Start Game:**
1. Map `setupPlayers` → player shape
2. `resetChart()` — destroys existing Chart.js instance before new game
3. `writeAll(newState)`, `Object.assign(state, newState)`
4. Hide `#winner-overlay`, call `showGameScreen()`

**End Game:**
1. Preserve names + colours back into `setupPlayers`
2. `resetChart()`, `writeAll(createResetState(...))`, `Object.assign(state, resetState)`
3. Hide `#winner-overlay`, call `resetGame()`
4. Show setup screen, sync button states

**📺 Open TV Display:** `window.open(location.pathname + '?view=display', '_blank')`

---

## 7. Dart Entry Pipeline (`game.js`)

### Public exports

| Export | Called by | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `showGameScreen()` | `setup.js` | Switches to game screen, initialises UI |
| `syncScoreView()` | `main.js` | Syncs screen state from storage on change; patches `#gs-score` live from `state.liveDarts` when a visit is in progress |
| `resetGame()` | `setup.js` | Clears `advancing`, `commitHistory`, calls `resetDartUI()` |

### Local UI state

| Variable | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `modifier` | `null\|'D'\|'T'` | Active multiplier toggle |
| `dartsThisVisit` | `{display,value}[]` | Current visit, max 3 |
| `isBust` | `boolean` | Bust detected |
| `advancing` | `boolean` | Async lock — blocks all input |
| `reviewMode` | `boolean` | Post-undo lock — numpad disabled |
| `commitHistory` | `{state,darts}[]` | Undo snapshot stack |

### `enterDart(baseValue, label?)`

Guards: `dartsThisVisit.length >= 3 || isBust || advancing`.

After pushing dart:
1. `_updateDartPreview()` — slots + live score
2. `patch({ liveDarts })` fire-and-forget — TV updates in ~100ms
3. Win check → `setTimeout(commitVisit(false), 900)` — records placement, may continue game
4. Bust check → banner + `setTimeout(commitVisit(true), 1500)`
5. 3rd dart → `setTimeout(commitVisit(false), 900)`

### `_updateDartPreview()`

Updates d1/d2/d3 slots and visit total.
Computes `wouldBust` independently (same condition as `enterDart`).
Calls `renderScoreStripLive(dartsThisVisit, wouldBust)` — passes array as argument.

### `commitVisit(bust)`

1. Push `{ state: deepClone, darts: [...dartsThisVisit] }` to `commitHistory`
2. Build `roundEntry = { darts: [...], bust }` — individual dart objects
3. Patch score, dart count, round entry
4. Win (`newScore === 0`):
   - Compute `position = Object.keys(state.placements).length + 1`
   - Patch `placements/${cpKey}: position`
   - Count remaining unfinished players (not in `placements`, not current)
   - If 1 remains: auto-assign last place, patch `gameOver: true`, `resetDartUI()`, return
   - If 0 remain: patch `gameOver: true`, `resetDartUI()`, return
   - If 2+ remain: fall through to `_advancePlayer()` — game continues
5. Normal: `patch()` → `_advancePlayer()`
6. `finally`: `advancing = false`, `renderScoreStrip()`, `updateCurrentPlayerHeader()`

### `_advancePlayer()`

Steps forward through the rotation, **skipping players already in `state.placements`**.
Round counter increments when the loop crosses the wrap-around boundary (higher index → lower).
Patches `currentPlayer`, `currentRound`, `liveDarts: null`, new round key if round incremented.
Calls `resetDartUI()`.

---

## 8. Review Mode (`game.js`)

Activated when `_goToPreviousPlayer()` restores darts with `length > 0`.

### `enterReviewMode()`
- `reviewMode = true`
- Disables all `.numpad-btn` except `#btn-del`
- Shows `#review-banner` and `#review-action`

### `exitReviewMode()`
- `reviewMode = false`
- Re-enables all `.numpad-btn`
- Hides `#review-banner` and `#review-action`

### `_goToPreviousPlayer()`
1. Pop `{ state: snapshot, darts }` from `commitHistory`
2. `writeAll(snapshot)` — atomic full state restore
3. `dartsThisVisit = darts`, clear bust/modifier/banner
4. `_updateDartPreview()`, `renderScoreStrip()`, `updateCurrentPlayerHeader()`
5. If darts exist → `enterReviewMode()`

### `_handleDelete()` in review mode
1. Pop last dart, call `exitReviewMode()`
2. Inspect removed dart display:
   - Starts with `D` (not just `D`) → `modifier = 'D'`, activate D button
   - Starts with `T` → `modifier = 'T'`, activate T button
3. Normal entry resumes

### `#confirm-visit-btn`
`exitReviewMode()` → `advancing = true` → `commitVisit(false)` immediately.

### `resetDartUI()`
Always calls `exitReviewMode()` — review mode cannot persist across advances.

---

## 9. Score View Renderers (`render-score.js`)

Passive — reads `state`, writes DOM only. Never writes storage.

### `renderScoreStrip()`
Full rebuild. Three-column flex per row:
- `.sr-col-name`: arrow + name (coloured if active)
- `.sr-col-darts`: 3× `.sr-dart` + avg — centred
- `.sr-col-score`: remaining score — right

### `updateCurrentPlayerHeader()`
Updates `#gs-name` (coloured), `#gs-score`, `#gs-pre-score`, `#player-color-bar` background.
- `#gs-pre-score` — committed score at turn start; frozen during the visit (muted colour)
- `#gs-score` — live remaining score; counts down per dart

### `renderScoreStripLive(dartsThisVisit, wouldBust)`
Patches phone DOM directly — no full rebuild. Receives `dartsThisVisit` array as argument.
Updates:
- `#gs-score` in the current-player header (live countdown)
- Score strip active row score and dart chips

TV updates (same-tab and cross-tab) come via `renderDisplayView()` called from `main.js`.

---

## 10. TV Display Renderers (`render-tv.js`)

Passive — reads `state`, writes DOM only. Never writes storage.

### Public exports

| Export | Called by | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `renderDisplayView()` | `main.js` | Full TV render, driven by `onStateChange` |
| `resetChart()` | `setup.js` | Destroys Chart.js instance, resets `_lastRoundsKey` |

### `renderDisplayView()`
```
hasPlayers → toggle #waiting-overlay
if !hasPlayers → return
_updateHeader()
_renderLeaderboard()
if _lastRoundsKey changed → _renderBurndown(); update _lastRoundsKey
winnerKey = first key in state.placements with value 1
if winnerKey && !_overlayDismissed → _showWinner(winnerKey)
else → hide #winner-overlay
```

`_overlayDismissed` is a module-level flag set when "Continue playing" is tapped.
Reset in `resetChart()` so a new game shows the overlay fresh.

### Chart update guard
`_lastRoundsKey = JSON.stringify(state.rounds)` compared on every render.
`_renderBurndown()` skipped if rounds unchanged (e.g. only `liveDarts` changed).
Reset to `null` via `resetChart()` on game start and End Game.

### `resetChart()`
Calls `_burnChart.destroy()` before nulling — fixes Y-axis max not resetting
when `startScore` changes between games (was a known bug in the previous version).

### `_renderLeaderboard()`
Three-column layout. For throwing player:
- Uses `state.liveDarts` if `player` matches → live dart chips + `.tv-dart-fresh` class
- `.tv-dart-fresh` → accent colour + `dartPop` scale animation
- Live score from `liveDarts.darts` sum, frozen on bust
- **Bust indicator:** `isBust = isThrow && wouldBust && liveDarts?.player === key && liveDarts.darts.length > 0`
  - Row gets `.bust` class → red border + dark red background
  - Score element shows `BUST!` in red instead of the numeric score
- **Border widths:** all rows `border-left-width: 14px`; throwing row `border-left-width: 21px` (colour from inline style, width from CSS class)
- **Vertical alignment:** leaderboard uses `justify-content: center` — rows float in the vertical middle

For **finished players** (key present in `state.placements`):
- Position label replaced with placement medal: 🥇 / 🥈 / 🥉 / number for 4th+
- `.top` gold style applied to placement 1 (actual winner), not row index 0
- Score column shows **DONE** in muted colour — no live score, no bust indicator

### `_renderBurndown()`
Chart.js line chart. Reads `rounds[rk][key]` as `{ darts, bust }`, sums dart values.
Created once on first call, updated with `.update()` on subsequent renders.

## 11. Reset Behaviour Summary

| Trigger | Score view | TV view |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Start Game | Game screen, hide winner | Hide waiting overlay |
| End Game | Setup screen, hide winner, clear history | Show waiting overlay |
| Undo (⌫ empty) | Restore state + darts, enter review mode | Full re-render |
| ⌫ in review | Remove dart, exit review, restore modifier | Live chip update |
| ✓ Confirm Visit | Exit review, commit immediately | Full re-render |
| Win | Commit, resetDartUI, liveDarts cleared | Show winner overlay |
| New game | Same as Start Game | Same as Start Game |

---

## 12. Known Constraints

- **liveDarts errors silently ignored** (`.catch(() => {})`). TV falls back to last committed darts.
- **Undo history is session-only**: page reload clears `commitHistory`.
- **Review mode is score-view only**: TV never enters review mode.
- **Same-tab sync**: `storage` event doesn't fire in writing tab — `darts-changed` CustomEvent covers same-tab.
- **Google Fonts and Chart.js require network**: loaded via CDN. The built `dist/index.html` works on `file://` but fonts and chart will not render without an internet connection.
- **`patch(null)` deletes keys, not sets them**: `Object.assign` skips absent keys — `onStateChange` has an explicit guard for `liveDarts` to handle this. Any future nullable fields added to state need the same treatment.
- **`advancing` flag is game-logic only**: gates input and async commit sequencing. It does not appear in any render function — `syncScoreView` derives the live header score from `state.liveDarts` instead.
- **`state.winner` removed**: first-place key is now derived from `state.placements`. Do not re-introduce `winner` — read `placements` instead.
- **`_overlayDismissed` edge case**: if a player undoes their winning dart after the overlay was dismissed, the overlay will not re-appear when they finish again. Placements are correctly reversed by undo; only the overlay suppression persists until a new game.

---

## 13. Extension Points

| Feature | Where to add |
|---------|-------------|
| Checkout suggestions | `checkouts.js` (lookup table drafted in `checkout-suggestions.md`); render in `_updateDartPreview()` + `_renderLeaderboard()` using remaining score and `dartsLeft = 3 - dartsThisVisit.length` |
| Double-out per-dart validation | `enterDart()` win check — verify last dart display starts with `D` |
| Sound effects | `commitVisit()`, `_showWinner()`, `enterReviewMode()` |
| Stats screen | `?view=stats`, reads `state.rounds` via `lastDarts()` |
| Multiple legs | Add `legs` to `state.settings`, track per-player win counts |
